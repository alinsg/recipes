This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is not my application idea, I used it to learn React ðŸ˜Š

Application uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for UI and [Food2Fork](https://www.food2fork.com/) API for getting recipes information.

## Home page

Home page contains the most popular 30 recipes from Food2Fork and a search bar for recipes.

Each recipe has a button for "Details" which, when pressed, will redirect to the Details Page amd a button to the recipe's original article.

## Details page

Details page contains the selected recipe's ingredients and two buttons: one for recipe's publisher page and another one for the recipe's original article.

## Observations

The API key is stored as .env variable so it needs to be replaced with your individual key in order for it to work.
